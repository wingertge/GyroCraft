 * This is the TileEntity for our MiniModel.

 * <p>
 * Rendering code only exists on the client distribution so @OnlyIn is used a lot.
 * The @OnlyIn annotation makes it so that a class/field/method annotated with it does not
 * exist on the other distribution. This is important as TileEntities exist on both distributions
 * but rendering only happens on the client.
 * As a general rule you should avoid using @OnlyIn unless it is absolutely necessary.
